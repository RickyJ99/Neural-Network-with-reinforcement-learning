    The main idea is to study how and whether the asymmetry of information have an impact on the cleansing effect of
    recession, replicating the model in computer  simulation.

\section[short]{Theoretical framework}
The economy consists of firms that are risk-neutral and have a constant discount rate represented by the parameter $0 <
\beta < 1$. These firms exhibit heterogeneity in terms of their productivity and net worth. They utilize a production
technology that takes capital (or production units) as the sole input, with diminishing returns to scale. 
\par
In each period, firms incur a fixed production cost denoted as $c$ to initiate production. Following production, firms
make decisions regarding the allocation of profits for the next period. The remaining portion of profits is invested in
a risk-free asset. Firms face a choice: they can either remain in the market and reinvest their profits or exit the
market entirely, investing their entire net worth, denoted as $e$, in the risk-free asset. 
\par
When firms choose to exit the market, they forgo any future profits, but they also free themselves from the financial
burden of the fixed cost represented by $c$. Consequently, firms opt to exit the market when the expected profits fail
to outweigh the fixed cost, or when the value of production becomes inferior to the value they could gain by investing
in the risk-free asset.
\par
This value, obtained from investing in the risk-free asset, is equal to $q_t +
\sum_{s=0}^{+\infty}\beta^s[\beta(1+r)-1]e_{t+s+1}$. Notably, when the condition $\beta(1+r) \leq 1$ holds true, this
value simplifies to $q$. In such cases, firms are either indifferent regarding the timing of dividend distributions or
have a preference for distributing their end-of-period net worth to shareholders or investors.

\par
The agents in this economy are the firms themselves, and they aim to maximize their value over time by selecting an
optimal level of capital denoted as $k$. The production function, after accounting for the fixed cost $c$, can be
expressed as follows: $Y = Z(\theta + \epsilon)k^\alpha$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Z$: is the stochastic aggregate productivity common across firms 
    \item $\theta$: is a persistent firm-specific productivity shock (model as a Markov Chain)     
    \item $\epsilon$: is the firm-specific productivity shock $\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma ) $
    \item $k^\alpha$: capital or production units as in (Caballero Hammour, AER)
\end{itemize}
The timeline of the events is the following

        }

\end{figure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item firm knows \(Z,\theta,k^\alpha,e\) where $e$ is its endowment\footnote{which is different from $k$ since the
    firm can borrow money: \(d=c+k-e\) where $d$ stays for debt} 
    \item firm compute the $k$ need to maximizes the expected value of the firm range can varies from \([0,+\infty]\) if
    $k=0$ it means that the firm decide to exit.
    \item at the end of the period the firm observe \(\epsilon_{t}\) and the aggregate shock
    \item repays its debt and the fixed operating cost \(c+k-e\), the firm its left with the end of period net worth $q$
    \item decide the amount the dividend to distribute \(q-e_{t+1}\) observe the productivity shock \(\theta_{t+1},
    Z_{t+1}\) and the step restart from 1
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Frictionless economy}
In a frictionless economy, firms have the option to borrow an amount denoted as \(c+k-e\) at the risk-free interest rate
\(r=\frac{1}{\beta}-1\). Therefore, at the start of the period, the firm's value is determined by the following
expression:

\[V_{FL} = \max_{k} E \int \max[q,\max_{e_{t+1}}(q - e_{t+1} + \beta V_{FL}(e_{t+1},\theta_{t+1}, Z_{t+1}))]  \,d\Phi
(\epsilon) \]
where the end of period net worth is equal to:
\[q=Z(\theta+\epsilon)k^\alpha + (1-\delta )k-(1+r)(c+k-e)\]

Under the condition of survival, it can be demonstrated that:

\[\widehat{V}_{FL}(\theta,Z) = \max_{k}E\int[Z(\theta+\epsilon)k^\alpha - (1+r)c\,d\Phi (\epsilon)] +
\beta\max[0,\widehat{V}_{FL}(\theta_{t+1},Z_{t+1})]\]

In the absence of market frictions, firms choose to exit when their productivity reaches a certain threshold.
Specifically, they exit if \(\theta_{t+1}<\underline{\theta} _{FL}(Z_{t+1})\), where \(\underline{\theta}
_{FL}(Z_{t+1})\) is defined as the value
for which \(\widehat{V}_{FL}(\underline{\theta}_{FL},Z_{t+1})=0\).
